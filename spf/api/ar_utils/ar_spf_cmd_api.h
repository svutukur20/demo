/** @ingroup spf_apm_commands
 This command carries an OOB payload from global shared memory (#APM_CMD_GLOBAL_SHARED_MEM_MAP_REGIONS)
 and used by the client to signal module to read the payload and handle accordingly.

 OOB payload structure and the communication protocol is private to client and module.

 Opcode -- AR_SPF_MSG_GLOBAL_SH_MEM

 @msgpayload
 ar_spf_msg_global_sh_mem_t

 @par
 This command can be issued for all the module instance IDs that were
 configured at least once using #APM_CMD_GRAPH_OPEN.

 @return

    @subhead{Bit 0 -- is_ack_not_required flag}

    Indicates if acknowledgment is needed for this command:
    - 1 -- Ack is not needed. This is useful if client only want to send the information and not waiting for the
    response. Client may still receive #GPR_IBASIC_RSP_RESULT in response to this command if command fails to reach the
    destination.

    - 0 -- Ack is needed. This is a common case where client wants to wait for the response.

    @subhead{Bit 1 -- is_release_memory flag}

    Indicates if client/HLOS wants module to release the specified shared memory. This can be used for cleanup or during
    error handling.
    - 1 -- release; used when client/HLOS wants module to stop reading/writing from/into the specified shared memory.
    If shmem_size is zero then client/HLOS wants module to stop using the entire shared memory region. This can be used
    just before shared memory is going to be unmapped.
    If shmem_size is non zero then client/HLOs wants module to stop using the memory block specified with msw,lsw.

    - 0 -- Default value; used when client wants module to read/use the specified shared memory.
